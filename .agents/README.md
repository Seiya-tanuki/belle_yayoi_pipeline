# AgentOS (repo-scoped)

This folder contains the repo-scoped agent configuration.

## Contents
- `skills/`: reusable workflows and protocols (invoked explicitly or implicitly).
- `playbooks/`: implementation behavior catalogs referenced by specs.
- `COMMANDS.md`: pseudo-commands you can type in chat.

## Philosophy
- Keep always-needed boundaries and indexes in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep long procedures in skills.
- Keep task-specific decisions in `.spec/specs/`.
