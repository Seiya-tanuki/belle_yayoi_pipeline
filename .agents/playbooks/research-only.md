# Playbook: research-only

## When to use
Use when no code changes are required; the deliverable is analysis, a report, or a recommendation.

## Deliverable
- Chat response is allowed.
- If a persistent artifact is needed, write a report under `.spec/reports/`.

## Structure
1. Problem statement
2. Constraints and assumptions
3. Options (at least 3): pros/cons, risks, cost
4. Recommendation with rationale
5. Next actions (if it should become an implementation spec)
